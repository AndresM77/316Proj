## Setup Backend

# Must have PostgreSQL installed (we are using 11.5)

Create `caction` db
```bash
createdb caction
```

Initialize db
```bash
psql -af init.sql caction
```

To run sample queries and populate the database run
```bash
psql caction -af test-sample.sql
```

Then
```bash
psql caction
CREATE USER username WITH LOGIN PASSWORD password;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO root;
```

Create a `.env` file in this directory with:
```
DB_USER=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=caction
```

[Might find some help here](https://gist.github.com/AtulKsol/4470d377b448e56468baef85af7fd614)

Then navigate into ./datastore and plug in your configurations for PostgreSQL database in credentials.js file.

Lastly, run
```bash
npm start
```
and this will load the top 100 rows of temperature data into the table.
